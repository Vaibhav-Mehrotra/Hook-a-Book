# hook_a_book
We, at Hook-A-Book web team, aim to create a fully functional and interactive website for the company Hook-A-Book, which is an online platform for the renting of used/old books. These extend to small retailers that have unsold books as well as to individuals as an incentive to be a part of the community. 
The website will provide several accessibility features and functionalities, all the while maintaining the aesthetic feel.

Some of the features are:

>> Login
>> Navigation via tabs
